Introduction
------------

This is the beginning of a tutorial on using Google App Engine to 
create an API interface in Python. By "API" I mean a framework which
allows you to retrieve data from a data store source, manipulate it,
update, create and delete it. This tutorial will be split into the
following parts:

  1. The App Engine framework
  2. Routing API calls
  3. Data model and data design
  4. Creating, updating and deleting data
  5. Using AngularJS to build a web application
  6. Authentication and authorization for API calls
  7. Using Google's Cloud SQL service
